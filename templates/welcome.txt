{{user.username}}, welcome to the beacon service!

You can use this service to create web beacons, referred to on this
service as "pixels", which are accessible by links on this server. 
These links serve a 1x1 PNG image. You can attach these to your email
messages. When your email is read, unless it is configured otherwise, the
recepient's email program will download the image. This service will log all
downloads of your image, which you can later examine to find out if your
message has been read, when, what program the reader was using, and their IP address.

You can also create an "access", which allows other people to look at the
stats for a pixel. You can enable and disable columns for them to see, and
you can limit how many visits they will be able to see. An access is also
optionally password-protected.

To get started, visit your dashboard at {{url_for('dashboard', _external=True)}}.

Yours, the beacon service.
