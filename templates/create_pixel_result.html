{% if success %}
Your pixel was successfully created and is now live at: <code>{{ pixel_url }}</code>. To view its stats, use this link: <a href="{{ stats_url }}">{{ stats_url }}</a>. The page is protected by the password you have chosen, which is:

<details>
  <summary>Click here to reveal your password:</summary>
  <code>{{ password }}</code>
</details>

To use this, you need to embed the pixel into your document. This can be done using HTML:<br>
<code><pre>
&lt;img src="{{ pixel_url }}" /&gt;
</pre></code><br>

If you require some other embed method, please consult your service's documentation.

{% else %}
An error occured while creating your pixel. The error was:

<code><pre>
{{ traceback }}
</pre></code>

Please report this error, and try to create your pixel again.
